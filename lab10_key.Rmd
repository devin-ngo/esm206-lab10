## beepr beeps 

Use the function `beep()` in the beepr package to make an audio alert when your code is done running. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (i in rev(seq(1:99))) {
  
  print(paste(i, "botles of beer on the wall"))
  
}

beep(5)
```

## praise and cowsay

Packages built with a single purpose: to be kind and fun. 

```{r}
praise("${Exclamation}, ${EXCLAMATION}...${exclamation}!!!!")

praise("Holy ${creating}, Batman - this code is ${ADJECTIVE}!")
```

Use cowsay::say() to make a character say something to you 

```{r}

```
